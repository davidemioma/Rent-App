Create a vpc, use vpc only, IPv4 CIDR manual input, IPv4 CIDR is the ranges your ip could be applied, we use "10.0.0.0/16".
Create subnets (2 private and 1 public) for security to watch who can connect to your vpc, choose the vpc you created and your closest availabilty zone, the second private subnet should have a different availabilty zone. for subnets, your IPv4 subnet CIDR block is "10.0.0.0/24" for public, "10.0.1.0/24" for the first private and "10.0.2.0/24" for the second one.
We need to create an internet gateway to connect to our vpc and attach it to the vpc you created.
We need to create routes tables (3) for each subnets, attach it to the vpc you created. when you create it click on "Edit subnet association" to link it to subnet.
We need to edit routes for public routes table so it will accessed through the internet. Click the "Edit routes" button and add route, Destination is "0.0.0.0/0" and Target is the internet gateway you created.
Now we setup EC2 instance, use linux, t2.micro, create a new key pair, allow SSH, HTTPS and HTTP then click edit. when editing assign your EC2 to your vpc and public subnet, then enable "Auto-assign public IP". We have to create our security group, allow SSH, HTTPS and HTTP (leave it do not change anything), then launch instance.
We then connect to our EC2 instance, use "Connect using EC2 Instance Connect" and leave the default settings.
Switch to super user using "sudo su -" then install nvm using "curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash", then activate nvm using ". ~/.nvm/nvm.sh".
Install node with nvm using "nvm install node" and "node -v" and "npm -v" to check if it's installed.
If you are using bun "curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash" and then add bun to your PATH using "echo 'export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc".
To check if bun is installed run "bun --version" if you want to run the frontend.
We then nees to update our instance using "sudo yum update -y".
We install Git using "sudo yum install git -y" and "git --version" to check if it's installed.
Now you clone your project repo using "git clone [your-github-link]". You need to authenticate if your repo is private. and use "ls" to view folders.
Use "cd folder_name" to enter a folder.
The backend is in Go. so we need to install Go using "wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz", then Extract and install "sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz", then Add Go to PATH using "echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc".
Run "go version" to check if it was installed, then install air "go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest", check if air is installed "~/go/bin/air -v" and add air to PATH "echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc".
Go to your server folder and run "go mod download".
Add port "80" to env because our vpc only allows to 80. Use "echo "PORT=80" > .env".
